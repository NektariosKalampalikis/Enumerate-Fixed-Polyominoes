# Enumerate-Polyominoes
This is a repository that contains implementations of known algorithms to count fixed polyominoes on python. An effort was made to mainly use python built-in modules.  

# Table of Values
| Polyomino Size   | Number of Fixed  |   
|---|---|
|  1 |  1 | 
|  2 |  2 | 
|  3 |  6 |
|  4 |  19 | 
|  5 |  63 | 
|  6 |  216 |
